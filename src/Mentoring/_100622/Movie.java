//        The class Movie is started below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class
//        has the following three class variables:
//        ● title, which is a Stringrepresenting the title of the movie
//        ● studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
//        ● rating, which is a Stringrepresenting the rating of the movie (i.e. PG 13, R, etc)

//        a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title of the
//        movie, a Stringrepresenting the studio, and a Stringrepresenting the rating as its
//        arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values.

//        b) Write a second constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title
//        of the movie and a Stringrepresenting the studio as its arguments, and sets the respective
//        class variables to these values, while the class variable ratingis set to "PG".

//        c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movieas its argument, and
//        returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may
//        assume the input array is full of Movieinstances. The returned array need not be full.

//        d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Moviewith the title “Casino
//        Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG 13”.
